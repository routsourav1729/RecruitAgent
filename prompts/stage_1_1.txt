[USER_PROMPT_BELOW]

Extract structured data from the resume text below.

**Resume File: {FILENAME}**

Resume text:
```
{TEXT_CONTENT}
```

**Extraction Instructions:**

Follow these steps to build the JSON output:

**Step 1: Profile Classification (Gating)**
- **domain**: Choose the single best match from: {DOMAINS}
- **sub_domain**: Provide a specific field within the chosen domain (e.g., "Accounts Payable", "Risk Analytics", "Software Development").
- **seniority**: Choose the best fit from: {SENIORITY_LEVELS}

**Step 2: Core Information**
- **candidate_name**: Extract the full name.
- **total_experience_years**: Calculate the total work experience as a number (e.g., 8.5).

**Step 3: Employment History**
- Extract ALL work experiences. For each job, include: `company`, `position`, `start_year` (YYYY), and `end_year` (YYYY or "Present").
- For `key_responsibilities`, extract 3-4 key achievements, prioritizing those with quantifiable metrics.

**Step 4: Education**
- Extract ALL educational qualifications, including `degree`, `specialization`, `institution`, `year`, and `score` if mentioned.

**Step 5: Skills**
- Categorize all mentioned skills into `technical`, `domain_knowledge`, and `professional` (soft skills).

**Step 6: Additional Information**
- **projects**: Extract any project names and brief descriptions.
- **certifications**: List all professional certifications.

**Output Format:**
Your final output must be a single, valid JSON object enclosed in a ```json ... ``` code block.
The JSON should contain the following top-level keys: `source_file`, `gating_profile`, `candidate_name`, `total_experience_years`, `employment_history`, `education`, `skills`, `projects`, `certifications`.
Ensure the value for `source_file` is "{FILENAME}".
Do not use a single backslash `\` as a separator in any string; use a forward slash `/` instead.
